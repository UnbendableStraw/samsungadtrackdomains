Samsung No Snooping!

hosts.txt is all domains I've captured that Samsung Smart TVs use to do anything other than watch Youtube, Netflix, and Google Play. Block all of them for total privacy and no ads. Note the comments

I use a Linksys router with OpenWRT and AdBlock. You could use a PiHole, or even a custom DNS service that lets you block domains.
